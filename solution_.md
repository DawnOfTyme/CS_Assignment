I used a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between "WO [x1000]" and "NL Beer consumption [x1000 hectoliter]" over time. While it shows a mild upward trend, the significant value disparities between the two variables make it challenging to assess correlation conclusively. Further statistical analysis is needed to quantify any correlation accurately.
